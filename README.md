# introduction

Project abstraction is a work-in-progress neural network project using similar algorithms for conversation modelling and physics event classification, featuring curated utterance-response data and word vector features.

**Note: abstraction is a *project*, not a finished product.**

# upcoming

Under consideration is a requirement for arcodex to ensure the existence of a response to an utterance before saving to database. Under consideration is changing from SkFlow to TF Learn.
